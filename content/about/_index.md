### Our Methodology

**1. Compliance by Design**
We believe that regulatory compliance should be fundamental to the code, not an afterthought. We architect database schemas and data pipelines that satisfy privacy laws (DPDP/GDPR) at the root level.

**2. Forensic Integrity**
In the courtroom, data is only as good as its chain of custody. We adhere to strict forensic standards (Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act) to ensure that server logs, API histories, and digital records remain admissible and verifiable.

**3. Strategic Clarity**
We demystify complex technical concepts for the judiciary, ensuring that the court understands the nature of the evidence presented.
