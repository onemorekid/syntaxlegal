### Not a Law Firm
Syntax Legal is a **Techno-Legal Consultancy**. We provide technical auditing, forensic analysis, and compliance architecture.
We are **not** a law firm and do not provide legal representation in court.

### No Attorney-Client Relationship
Accessing this website, reading our documentation, or sending us an email does **not** create an attorney-client relationship. All "Advice" provided on this site is for educational and architectural purposes only.

### Strategic Litigation
Litigation support and courtroom advocacy are provided exclusively through our strategic partners, the **Chambers of [Father-in-Law's Name], District Judge (Retd.)**. Engagement for legal representation requires a separate Vakalatnama.
