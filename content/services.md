### 1. Digital Forensics & Evidence Packaging
**"A screenshot is not evidence."**
We specialize in extracting, preserving, and certifying digital evidence for court admissibility.
* **Server Log Analysis:** We audit Apache/Nginx logs to trace IP addresses and timestamps.
* **Section 65B Certification:** We generate the technical certificates required under the Indian Evidence Act (BSA) to make electronic records admissible.
* **Chain of Custody:** We use cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) to prove that data has not been tampered with between extraction and the courtroom.

### 2. Privacy Engineering (DPDP Act 2023)
**"Compliance is code, not just policy."**
We help CTOs and Product Managers architect systems that are compliant by design.
* **Data Minimization Audits:** Reviewing database schemas to ensure you only collect legally necessary data.
* **Right to Erasure Workflows:** Designing automated pipelines to delete user data upon request (a mandatory requirement under the DPDP Act).
* **Consent Management:** UX/UI reviews to ensure your "I Agree" buttons meet the legal standard of "Informed Consent."

### 3. Strategic Litigation Advisory
**"Technical facts need legal strategy."**
*Provided via the Chambers of [Father-in-Law's Name], District & Sessions Judge (Retd.)*

While we handle the technical forensics, complex litigation requires deep procedural wisdom.
* **Appellate Strategy:** Reviewing lower court judgments for technical errors.
* **White Collar Defense:** Strategies for financial fraud and cyber-crime accusations.
* **Arbitration:** Handling commercial disputes where technical details are the deciding factor.
